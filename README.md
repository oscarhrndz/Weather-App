# Weather-App

This is a programme based in HTML, CSS and Javascript. The programme shows the weather (temperature, climate and wind speed) of the city that you introduce in the search box.
I've used some images to make it more interactive. 
I'm going to improve the code and the images to create a better weather app. I did this app to help me when I need it in another app or website.
This project is based in the weather app by @AsmrProg on YouTube or @AsmrProg-YT.
